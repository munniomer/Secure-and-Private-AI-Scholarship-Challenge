# Neural Networks
Chapter Notes for lesson 2, Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks vaguely mimic the way the brain operates, with neurons that fire bits of information.

Deep neural networks have a greater number of hidden layers , and consequently more nodes, ore edges, and more information entering and leaving the cells.

One kind of problem that neural networks are used to solve is **classification** involving in the case of binary, something as simple as acceptance, or rejection.

**Binary classification** involves the identification of a linear boundary to demarcate selected vs rejected cases. This prediction is made on the basis of a linear equation of the form w<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + b = 0.
